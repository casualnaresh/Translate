# Translate

1) Create a Cognitive Services resource using the Azure portal.
   i. Using a Single-service resource, created a resource for Translator Cognitive Service.
   ii. After creating the service, it generates a key to utilise the service resource in our application.
2) I used the key in my controller as a constant variable.
3) I have also given the translation end point from the Microsoft translator API.
4) After running the application in localhost, it generates the text as an end point where you can provide any form of text in English to translate in to French.
Here, I am using the text to tanslate from English to French as an example.
